// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

let myName = "Umair Bin Nasir";
let currentDate: Date = new Date();
console.log(myName, currentDate);
// First, assigned a name to one variable and current date to another variable and then printed a message of name and current date. 

let famous_person = "Adolf Hitler";
let quote = "He who would live must fight. He who doesn't wish to fight in this world, where permanent struggle is the law of life, has not the right to exist.";
console.log(`${famous_person} once said, ${quote}`);
// First, assigned a famous person's name to one variable and his quote to another variable and then printed a message of his name and his quote.
